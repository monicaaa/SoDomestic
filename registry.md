What we want most for our wedding is to have our families together on our big day. After moving in together last year, we are lucky to have much of what we need to make our house a home. If you wish to get us something nevertheless, [our registry](https://www.zola.com/registry/king/){:target="_blank"} contains some things we would like to make our home even more perfect. Our house is just big enough for the two of us and our dog, Luna, so we don't have much room for extras.

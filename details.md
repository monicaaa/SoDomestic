We are so excited to celebrate our wedding day with our immediate families! We want this trip to be a relaxed and fun time for our families to get to know each other. We truly appreciate everybody for flying long distances to Canada to join us as we tie the knot.

### Getting & Staying Here

We have reserved the entire Casa Bianca house for Tuesday and Wednesday night so that our guests don't have to worry about accommodations. The venue sits across from the magnificent Parc du Mont-Royal (Mount Royal Park). Please enjoy the view and take advantage of the beautiful scenery. There are also two parking spots available on the premises. While not necessary, if you choose to rent a car during your stay, please let us know so we can make sure the parking space will be available.

You should fly into the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Airport in Montreal. The easiest way to get to Casa Bianca from the airport is by taxi ($40+, 30 minutes). You can also take the [747 Airport Bus](http://www.stm.info/en/info/networks/bus/shuttle/more-about-747-aeroport-p-e-trudeau-centre-ville-shuttle){:target="_blank"} ($10, 50 minutes), which will take you to downtown. From there, you can take a taxi or transfer to another bus line. Eric and Monica once took it at 4AM. It was quite comfortable.

### The Day Before
 A good day to fly in, tour the city, and relax. We have made reservations for dinner on Tuesday night at TBD in the TBD. We hope you will join us there!

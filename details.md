We are so excited to celebrate our wedding day with our immediate families! We want this trip to be a relaxed and fun time for our families to get to know each other. We truly appreciate everybody for flying long distances to Canada to join us as we tie the knot.

### Canadian Dollar
Quick note about the currency in Canada. The Canadian dollar (CAD) has been falling for the last couple of years against the dollar. Here is an [up-to-date](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&es_th=1&ie=UTF-8#q=cad%20to%20usd){:target="_blank"} look at the exchange rate. 

### Getting & Staying Here

We have reserved the entire Casa Bianca house for Tuesday and Wednesday night so that our guests don't have to worry about accommodations. The venue sits across from the magnificent Parc du Mont-Royal (Mount Royal Park). Please enjoy the view and take advantage of the beautiful scenery. There are also two parking spots available on the premises. While not necessary, if you choose to rent a car during your stay, please let us know so we can make sure there are enough parking spaces for everyone who will rent a car.

Montreal, Quebec

You should fly into the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Airport in Montreal. The easiest way to get to Casa Bianca from the airport is by taxi ($40+, 30 minutes). You can also take the [747 Airport Bus](http://www.stm.info/en/info/networks/bus/shuttle/more-about-747-aeroport-p-e-trudeau-centre-ville-shuttle){:target="_blank"} ($10, 50 minutes), which will take you to downtown. From there, you can take a taxi or transfer to another bus line. Eric and Monica once took it at 4AM. It was quite comfortable.

### The Day Before
A good day to fly in, tour the city, and relax. Carla and Bob are hosting a welcome dinner on Tuesday at 7PM at the [Maison Boulud](http://www.maisonboulud.com/montreal/){:target="_blank"} in the Ritz-Carleton Montreal. 

### The Big Day

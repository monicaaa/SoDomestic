We are so excited to celebrate our wedding day with our immediate families! We hope this trip to be a relaxed and fun time for our families to get to know each other. We truly appreciate everybody for flying far distances to Canada to join us as we tie the knot.

### Getting and Staying Here

We have reserved the entire Casa Bianca house for Tuesday and Wednesday night so that our guests don't have to worry about accommodations. The venue sits across from the magnificent Parc du Mont-Royal (Mount Royal Park). Please enjoy the view and take advantage of the proximity to the outdoors. There are also up to two parking spots available on the premises. While not necessary, if you choose to rent a car during your stay, please let us know so we can make sure the parking space will be available. 

You should fly into the Pierre Elliott Trudeau Airport in Montreal. The easiest way to get to Casa Bianca from the airport is by taxi ($40+, 30 minutes). You can also take the [747 Airport Bus](http://www.stm.info/en/info/networks/bus/shuttle/more-about-747-aeroport-p-e-trudeau-centre-ville-shuttle){:target="_blank"} ($10, 50 minutes), which will take you to downtown. From there, you can take a taxi or transfer to another bus line. Eric and Monica once took it at 4AM. It was quite comfortable.

### The Day Before
 A good day to fly in, tour the city, and relax. We have made reservations for dinner on Tuesday night at TBD in the TBD. We hope you will join us there!

### The Big Day
Lots happening here.

### Excursions and Must-Sees
If you choose to arrive before Tuesday or stay after Wednesday, the Casa Bianca may have available rooms for you to extend your stay. If there is enough interest, we might plan a Quebec City trip immediately after the wedding.

There is also so much to see, eat, and do in Montreal! These are our recommendations:

* **Poutine**:You must eat poutine in Montreal! One of the most famous is <a target="_blank" href="http://labanquise.com/">La Banquise</a> (20 minute walk from the Casa Bianca). But, really, they are everywhere. 
* **Bagels**: There are two strong contenders for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2009/11/what-are-montreal-bagels-the-best-fairmount-vs-st-viateur-rivalry-canada.html">best Montreal bagels</a>. They are <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fairmountbagel.com/">Fairmount Bagel</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stviateurbagel.com/">St-Viateur Bagel</a>. We think you can't go wrong either way.  
* **Basilicas**: See the beautiful <a target="_blank" href="http://www.basiliquenotredame.ca/en/">Notre-Dame Basilica</a> or the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stpatricksmtl.ca/">Saint Patrick's Basilica</a> in Downtown Montreal

If you choose to arrive before Tuesday or stay after Wednesday, the Casa Bianca may have available rooms for you to extend your stay. If there is enough interest, we might plan a Quebec City trip immediately after the wedding.

There is also so much to see, eat, and do in Montreal! These are our recommendations:

* **Poutine**:You must eat poutine in Montreal! One of the most famous is <a target="_blank" href="http://labanquise.com/">La Banquise</a> (20 minute walk from the Casa Bianca). But, really, they are everywhere. 
* **Bagels**: There are two strong contenders for [best Montreal bagels](http://www.seriouseats.com/2009/11/what-are-montreal-bagels-the-best-fairmount-vs-st-viateur-rivalry-canada.html){:target="_blank"}. They are [Fairmount Bagels](http://www.fairmountbagel.com/){:target="_blank"} and [St-Viateur Bagel](http://www.stviateurbagel.com/){:target="_blank"}. We think you can't go wrong either way.  
* **Basilicas**: See the beautiful [Notre-Dame Basilica](http://www.basiliquenotredame.ca/en/){:target="_blank"} or the [Saint Patrick's Basilica](http://www.stpatricksmtl.ca/){:target="_blank"} in downtown Montreal.
* **Nature**: Check out [Parc du Mont Royal](http://www.montreal.com/parks/mtroyal.html){:target="_blank"} steps away from the Casa Bianca. Walk along the [Lachine Canal](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g155032-d1815342-Reviews-Lieu_Historique_National_du_Canal_de_Lachine-Montreal_Quebec.html){:target="_blank"}. Explore [Parc Jean-Drapeau](http://www.parcjeandrapeau.com/en/){:target="_blank"} on the nearby island. 
* **Museums**: See the [Museum of Fine Arts](http://www.mbam.qc.ca/en/){:target="_blank"},the [Biodome, Botanical Garden and Insectarium](http://espacepourlavie.ca/en/biodome){:target="_blank"}, and the [Biosphere](https://www.ec.gc.ca/biosphere/){:target="_blank"} at Parc Jean-Drapeau.
